RB-Falcon, capable of image recognition, is an all-in-one quadcopter flight controller using a STM32F765 MCU. 
Built-in sensors include IMU(LSM9DS1), Pressure&Temp(BMP280), and Image(OV7725). 
Also included chips on board are a NRF24L01 for remote control, a STC4054 for charging a Li-Ion battery, and four 30V N-channel MOSFETs for motors.
The main programming language is Micropython. RB-Falcon can be programmed using Thonny or OPENMV IDEs.
Micropython scripts in this repository are for demonstrating AHRS algorithms like Mahony and Madgwick.
